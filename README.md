# Introduction to PySpark and MLLib

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that provides an introduction to using PySpark and MLLib for data processing and machine learning. The notebook demonstrates how to interact with Spark using Python, understand Spark DataFrames, and implement linear regression using PySpark.

## Repository Contents

- `Introduction_to_PySpark_and_MLLib.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook that covers the basics of PySpark and MLLib, including setup, usage, and examples.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this experiment, you will be able to:

- Interact with Spark using Python
- Understand Spark DataFrames
- Implement linear regression using PySpark

## Getting Started

To get started with the notebook, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Apache Spark
- Necessary Python packages (listed in the `requirements.txt` file)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Praveen76/Introduction-to-PySpark-and-MLLib.git
    cd Introduction-to-PySpark-and-MLLib
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Ensure Apache Spark is installed and properly configured on your system. You can download it from the [Apache Spark website](https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html).

### Usage

    ```sh
    jupyter notebook
    ```

    or

    ```sh
    jupyter lab
    ```

2. Open the notebook `Introduction_to_PySpark_and_MLLib.ipynb`.

3. Follow the instructions and run the cells in the notebook to learn about and use PySpark and MLLib for data processing and machine learning.

## Notes

- The notebook contains various examples and use cases for PySpark and MLLib. Modify the examples as needed to fit your specific requirements.
